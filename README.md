### Week 01: Web Scraping & Data Collection 🕸️

In Week 01, we explore the basics of web scraping using Python. The main script connects to the Hong Kong Observatory website to fetch tide data. Key concepts covered include:

- Loading environment variables with `python-dotenv`
- Making HTTP requests with the `requests` library
- Parsing HTML using `lxml`
- Working with XPath to extract specific data from web pages
- File handling for storing and retrieving web content

This week establishes fundamental data collection techniques that will be used throughout the course.

## 🧪 Extra Resources

The `/extra` folder contains additional code examples and experimental projects that might be helpful for your assignments:

- Various computer vision examples with OpenCV and diffusion models
- Nake code examples
- Y-R-we-here project samples

Feel free to explore these examples for inspiration or as starting points for your own projects!
